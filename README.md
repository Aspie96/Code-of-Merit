# This repository
This repository is meant to maintain the Code of Merit from [Roberto Rosario GonzÃ¡lez](https://gitlab.com/rosarior). He was previously on GitHub at [@rosarior](https://github.com/rosarior).

In March 2019, Roberto shut down all of his projects.

Since this Code of Merit has been used by some projects, I figured it is important to keep it, even just for archival purposes. For this reason, I created this repository.

## Branches
The repository I forked contained 5 different branches. I deleted all but the following two, since their most recent commits were not from Rosario:
- master: It is the current branch, containing this documentation.
- gh-pages: It is the GitHub Pages branch, containing the website.

# Code of Merit
