# This repository
This repository is meant to maintain the Code of Merit from [Roberto Rosario GonzÃ¡lez](https://gitlab.com/rosarior). He was previously on GitHub at [@rosarior](https://github.com/rosarior).

In March 2019, Roberto shut down all of his projects except for [Mayan EDMS](https://www.mayan-edms.com/).

Since this Code of Merit has been used by some projects, I figured it is important to keep it, even just for archival purposes. For this reason, I created this repository.

# Code of Merit
