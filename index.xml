      <description>The project creators, lead developers, core team, constitute the managing members of the project and have final say in every decision of the project, technical or otherwise, including overruling previous decisions. There are no limitations to this decisional power. Contributions are an expected result of your membership on the project. Don&#39;t expect others to do your work or help you with your work forever. All members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want within the project.</description>
